# UFOs

OVERVIEW of Project: The purpose of the analysis is to help Dana understand global UFO sightings through creation of an easy sorting tool. 

RESULTS: Someone can easily utilize this tool (challengefinal.html website) to sort UFO sightings on city, state, country and date. Sightings can then be easily reviewed and referenced. Importantly, not all data fields need to be populated, so data can be searched on one term at a time for easy narrowing down. 

SUMMARY: One drawback is that details are sparse and we don't know much about the quality of the witness account- how many people witnessed? who reported it?
Further developments could include a citation of the reference as another searchable field, for instance, the sighting was discovered in a newspaper report, etc. Another potential area for development would be to include real time updates or reports as new sightings come in.
